# STRING FUNCTIONS
# len() - calculate the length of a string: general purpose and can be used on other data types
course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(len(course)) # -> 20


#  STRING METHODS
# .upper() - converts a str to uppercase letters. DOES NOT MODIFY ORIGINAL STRING
# .lower() - converts a str to loowercase letters. DOES NOT MODIFY ORIGINAL STRING
# .find(str) - returns the index when str is FIRST spotted. returns -1 when not found. CASE SENSATIVE
# .replace(old str, new str) - replaces the first argument with the second argument in all instances. CASE SENSATIVE
# .count('str') - counts the number of occurrences of one string in another.
# 'str' in string_variable - checks to see if str exsits in the string variable and returns a bool. CASE SENSATIVE
# .split(char in quotes) - splits the string into an array based on the character in the argument
# 'char in quotes'.join(string_variable) - joins an array into a string based on the character in quotes


print(course.upper()) # -> PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS
print(course.lower()) # -> python for beginners
print(course.find('e')) # -> 12 (the first e is found at index 12)
print(course.find('Y')) # -> -1 (not found)
print(course.find('Beginners')) # -> 11 the word starts at index 11
print(course.replace('Beginners', 'Absolute Beginners')) # -> Python for Absolute Beginners
print(course.replace('beginners', 'Absolute Beginners')) # -> Python for Beginners (beginners was not found so it didn't replace anything)
print(course.replace('n', 'm')) # -> Pythom for Begimmers
print(course.count('for')) # -> 1
print('Python' in course) # -> True
print('FOR' in course) # -> False
print(course.split(' ')) # -> ['Python', 'for', 'Beginners']
print(course.split('e')) # -> ['Python for B', 'ginn', 'rs']
