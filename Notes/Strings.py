# STRING METHODS

# len() - calculate the length of a string: general purpose and can be used on other data types
course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(len(course)) # -> 20

# EXCLUSIVE string methods
# .upper(str) - converts a str to uppercase letters. DOES NOT MODIFY ORIGINAL STRING
# .lower(str) - converts a str to loowercase letters. DOES NOT MODIFY ORIGINAL STRING
# .find(str) - returns the index when str is FIRST spotted. returns -1 when not found. CASE SENSATIVE
# .replace(old str, new str) - replaces the first argument with the second argument in all instances. CASE SENSATIVE
# 'str' in string_variable - checks to see if str exsits in the string variable and returns a bool .CASE SENSATIVE
print(course.upper()) # -> PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS
print(course.lower()) # -> python for beginners
print(course.find('e')) # -> 12 (the first e is found at index 12)
print(course.find('Y')) # -> -1 (not found)
print(course.find('Beginners')) # -> 11 the word starts at index 11
print(course.replace('Beginners', 'Absolute Beginners')) # -> Python for Absolute Beginners
print(course.replace('beginners', 'Absolute Beginners')) # -> Python for Beginners (beginners was not found so it didn't replace anything)
print(course.replace('n', 'm')) # -> Pythom for Begimmers
